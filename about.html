                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>HealthCare Connect was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful idea: healthcare scheduling should be as easy as booking a restaurant reservation. Frustrated by the complexity and inconvenience of traditional appointment booking systems, our founders set out to create a solution that would benefit both patients and healthcare providers.</p>
                    <p>Starting with a small network of local hospitals, we've grown to partner with multiple healthcare facilities and dozens of expert doctors across various specialties. Today, thousands of patients trust HealthCare Connect to manage their healthcare appointments.</p>
                    <p>Our journey continues as we expand our services, improve our platform, and work towards our vision of making quality healthcare accessible to everyone.</p>
